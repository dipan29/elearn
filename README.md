make coupon codes course specific, I guess that is better than global. Also allow global or course wise.  ✅


* multi-level directory of category (Course (GATE) -> ECE, this much)  

*For the enroll Part*  
People can enroll for a course that will have 10 sub courses, you may call me to understand this. Say for example you have GATE->ECE->Analog Electronics. Now there can be 10 subjects under course. If someone purchases GATE course, he will get 10 enrolls automatically as sir will allow each one of them individually. Mane people will buy main category course like GATE->ECE, but will have 10 sub category will behave as independent course, which can be individually enabled in enrolls. **This is a important feature sir told me, just today**.  


otp based login, purchase course notification and course payment sucessfull notification -> I will give you apis, you will cURL them.  
Basically on course cart, just send a notification to pay.  
and if the admin approves mane the enroll then ekta sms jabey approved. Will show the APIs, easy.  


* databse targetted front page (Site Title, Description, Image, Gradient Points, Site Logo & and the three meta datas)  ✅
